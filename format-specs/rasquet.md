# Rasquet Specification v0.1.0

## Overview

Rasquet is a specification for storing and querying raster data using [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), a column-oriented data file format.

## Data Organization

The format organizes raster data in the following way:

1. The raster is divided into regular tiles (blocks). The block size MUST be divisible by 16. Common block sizes are 256x256 and 512x512.
2. [QUADBIN](#tiling-scheme) spatial indexing is used to identify and locate tiles. Each tile is assigned a QUADBIN cell ID based on its spatial location. Example: if QUADBIN level is 13 at pixel resolution and the block size is 256x256, the QUADBIN level of the block is 5.
3. Tile data is stored in a columnar structure for efficient access. Each tile is stored as a row in the file. The data within the bands in the tile is stored as separated columns, and pixels for the band is stored as binary encoded Numpy arrays, optionally zlib compressed.
4. Overview pyramids can be optionally preserved for multi-resolution queries. Overview factors MUST be consecutive powers of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).
5. Empty tiles (containing only NoData values) are optionally excluded to save space.
6. Rich metadata, containing statistics and other information, is included for data discovery and analysis.

This organization enables efficient spatial queries, band selection, and resolution-based filtering while maintaining compatibility with standard Parquet tools and workflows.

## File Structure

A Rasquet file must contain:

### Primary Table

Required columns:
- `block`: QUADBIN cell identifier (uint64) that represents the spatial location of the tile.
- One or more band columns (bytes) containing the actual raster data for each band. The name of the column MUST be the name of the band and band names are defined in the metadata. A common way to define band names is to use the following convention: `band_<band_index>`.
- `metadata`: String column containing the raster metadata in JSON format. This column MUST only have one row where `block = 0`. All other rows in this column MUST be NULL.

## Column Specifications

### Required Columns

#### block Column
- Type: uint64
- Description: QUADBIN cell identifier that encodes the tile's spatial location and zoom level.
- Special value: `block = 0` is reserved for the metadata row.

#### Band Columns
- Type: bytes
- Naming convention: Configurable band names, optionally following the convention `band_<band_index>` (e.g., "band_1", "band_2", etc.).
- Content: Raw binary data of the raster tile.
- Format: Binary-encoded array of pixel values stored in row-major order (pixels are stored row by row from top to bottom, and within each row from left to right). The encoded array is represented as a flat binary array of the pixel values.
- Optional compression: Can be zlib compressed.

#### Metadata Column
- Type: string
- Content: JSON string containing raster metadata.
- Special handling: Only populated in the row where `block = 0`, NULL in all other rows.
- Format: See [Metadata Specification](#metadata-specification) for the JSON structure.

## Tiling Scheme

Rasquet uses the QUADBIN tiling scheme for spatial indexing. [QUADBIN](https://docs.carto.com/data-and-analysis/analytics-toolbox-for-bigquery/key-concepts/spatial-indexes#quadbin) is a hierarchical geospatial index based on the Bing Maps Tile System (Quadkey). Designed to be cluster-efficient, it stores in a 64-bit number the information to uniquely identify any of the grid cells that result from uniformly subdividing a map in Mercator projection into four squares at different resolution levels, from 0 to 26 (less than 1mÂ² at the equator). The bit layout is inspired in the H3 design, and provides different modes to store not only cells, but edges, corners or vertices.

The tilling scheme is defined by the following parameters:
- Each tile is identified by a QUADBIN cell ID (uint64).
- The resolution level is encoded in the QUADBIN cell ID
- Tiles are aligned to the QUADBIN grid at the specified resolution
- Default tile size is 256x256 pixels

## File Creation

The file creation process includes:
1. Dividing the raster into tiles.
2. Computing QUADBIN cell IDs for each tile.
3. Converting tile data (pixel values) to binary format.
4. Optional compression of tile data
5. Writing metadata and tile data to Parquet format

## Metadata Specification

The metadata is stored as a JSON string in the `metadata` column where `block = 0`. The JSON object has the following structure:

```json
{
    "compression": "gzip",
    "block_resolution": 6,
    "nodata": null,
    "bands": [{
        "type": "float32",
        "name": "elevation",
        "stats": {
            "min": -413.0,
            "max": 8848.0,
            "mean": 339.2,
            "stddev": 784.5,
            "approximated_stats": false
        }
    }]
}
```

## File Extension

Rasquet files MUST use `.parquet` as the file extension. This ensures compatibility with existing Parquet tools and maintains consistency with the underlying file format.

## Media Type

If a [media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) (formerly: MIME type) is used, a Rasquet file MUST use [application/vnd.apache.parquet](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.apache.parquet) as the media type.

## COG to Rasquet Conversion

While Rasquet files can be created from scratch following this specification, the format was designed to efficiently store [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)](https://www.cogeo.org/) data in a columnar format. When converting from COG to Rasquet, the source file MUST meet these requirements:

1. **Tiling Scheme**: Must have `TILING_SCHEME=GoogleMapsCompatible` in the GeoTIFF tags
2. **Overview Structure**: Overview factors MUST be consecutive powers of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, ...)
3. **Block Size**: All bands MUST have the same block size

These requirements ensure optimal conversion to Rasquet's QUADBIN tiling scheme and efficient overview level handling. For other data sources, implementers MUST ensure their data is organized according to the specifications in the following sections.
